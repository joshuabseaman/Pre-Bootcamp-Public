<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Josh, and I live in Colorado Springs. I own a house with my girlfriend, Audrey. We have three dogs named Havok, Rooney, and Toby; we also have a bearded dragon named Percy.</p>
<p>A couple of fun facts about me: I used to be in a touring band, and I have a tattoo of Ron Burgundy.</p>
<p>I am taking the Boot Camp as a career reinvention. After working in lots of different industries over the years, I am looking forward to a dedicated career path within sofware engineering.</p>
